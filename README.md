# Where is Bigfoot?
An attempt to find Bigfoot.

## Background
I was looking for some interesting and funny datasets for my statistics project this semester. During my search I have found [this dataset](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data), made public by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). Since it did not fulfill my professor's requirements, I have decided to turn it into my own little project and learn some geospatial data plotting in Python. Who knows, maybe I will be the one to find Bigfoot?

## Goal
I believe any project needs to have a well-defined goal. For now, mine will be to create a simple map of all Bigfoot sightings and try to turn it into an animation in order to track the elusive animal's movement. More ideas will probably emerge throughout my research. Let's get into it.
